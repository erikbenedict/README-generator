# README Generator

## Description

As a developer I wanted a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project. Your time should be focused on creating something amazing that solves problems and helps others. Implementing DRY practices like this will allow you to put more energy and time into the project, rather than creating a README from scratch every time.

## Built With
